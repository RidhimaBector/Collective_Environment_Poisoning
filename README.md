# Collective Environment Poisoning

"Poisoning the Well: Can We Simultaneously Attack a Group of Learning Agents?" accepted at the 32nd International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI 2023) introduces the multi-agent training-time environment-poisoning attack paradigm. The attacks are tested on 3 scenarios (Implicit Collective, True Collective, Swarm Collective) instantiated under the Collective Environment Poisoning (CEP) Framework.
